    <!-- I noticed aside from navigation, you have not sectioned
         off the different areas of your content with header,
         section tags.

         One major tip for throughout your document - - your tags
         should hug the content. Don't leave whitespace between 
         them. 

         I figure you may have done this for easier readability,
         but its something you just have to get used to.

         If you look at your links, you'll see that extra space
         is picked up (see a little added underline)? It can
         cause issues when you're trying to add padding to
         styling. So keep your content and tags snug. :)

    <!-- This would be an ideal area to have a header begin -->

    <!-- You can use an 'a' tag to create a link for your address which
         would allow someone to click on it and send you an email. You 
         should still look into how one does that, but that method is a 
         way spammers harvest email addresses, so... instead, try using
         http://hivelogic.com/enkoder/ to include a link to your
         email address.

         HOWEVER... there is a big problem in the way you implemented

         That's kind of an added bonus for user interface and 
         experience. 

         Remember, you could use an unordered list for your navigation
         which may help styling. Or, perhaps, you'll find a way to
         style this without using a list. :)
